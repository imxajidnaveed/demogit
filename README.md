# Demo HTML Site

This is a **demo project** created for students to practice Git collaboration and commits.  
It is a simple HTML-based project where each student can contribute by adding commits, design updates, or documentation.

(I wrote this `README.md` and plan to update the site’s color theme from red to purple.)
